# DartNet - P2P social network test in Beaker browser

## What is it?

- A test on how the Beaker Browser P2P APIs might work

## What can you do?

- Customize a profile (colors, image, name whatever you want)
- Make posts for your followers to see
- Share posts from people you follow

## How does it work?

- Peer to Peer means no server so the page needs to be cloned for everyone that wants to be a user
- If you wish to follow someone's posts you add their cloned page URL to your `profile.json`
